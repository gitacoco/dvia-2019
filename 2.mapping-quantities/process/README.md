### External Data: sixty-three years of radiocarbon dioxide measurements at Wellington, New Zealand (1954-2017)
I chose the Carbon-14 data of New Zealand, which is the world’s longest record. I downloaded the data through [World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases](https://gaw.kishou.go.jp/search) where you could access the dataset. You could also access the [DATASET](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR9YwmsYN-sKPuY03hTzqzvdE6TbmHnMo1rUF8z_-T27T_EepPJryzY4S8iEmzLswMhXLGiqJG6Qy_k/pubhtml?gid=574694187&single=true) and the [VARIABLE ATTRIBUTES](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR9YwmsYN-sKPuY03hTzqzvdE6TbmHnMo1rUF8z_-T27T_EepPJryzY4S8iEmzLswMhXLGiqJG6Qy_k/pubhtml?gid=910863073&single=true) for this project through my Google Sheets Spreadsheet Form.  

> "Carbon-14 is produced naturally in the atmosphere by a chemical reaction triggered by cosmic rays. Nuclear weapon testing in the 1950s and early 1960s led to a rapid rise in atmospheric levels."

## Week 6 Assignment
### A Thousand Suns: Mapping Quantities, Categories, and Summarized Data
#### 01: Chart of Nuclear Testing Illustrating Variables of Year, Country, Testing Frequency and Location
![illustrative images](./1_Timelines.jpg)
For this chart, lines are plotted to connect the testing active years of each country (the retinal variable: color, shape), whose continuity allows audiences to identify whether there is nuclear testing of a certain year. This is a method to address the 'lull' that resulted from the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in ’96 and the more recent resurgence in testing. And the height changes of the line are to map the testing frequency.

This idea was inspired by the Influential Timelines of Joseph Priestley.

#### 02: Chart of Nuclear Testing Illustrating Variables of Year, Country and Testing Frequency
![illustrative images](./2_ThemeRiver.jpg)
For this chart, I use a Stream Graph to simultaneously show the testing frequency of all countries (the retinal variable: shape) and each country (the retinal variable: color) during the progression of time lapse, reflecting the change of the overall trend while allowing people to identify the proportion of a specific country. In this chart, a audiency could also find it easy to perceive an obvious 'lull' resulted from the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in ’96.

#### 02: Chart of Nuclear Testing Illustrating Variables of Year, Country and Testing Frequency
![illustrative images](./3_BubbleChart.jpg)
For this chart, I use a Bubble Chart to visulize nuclear testing data and then to compare the testing trend and show the relationships between countries by the use of positioning and proportions. This overall picture reveals the correlation of the background of Cold War.

### Additional Sketch
#### Sketch 1: the Contribution to the Testing Frequency of Each Country and its Evolution
![illustrative images](./Sketch1.jpeg)
This idea is to use different individual axis to map the timeline in proportion based on the TimeWheel Technique as a variant of Parallel Coordinates.

#### Sketch 2: the Accumulated Testing Frequency of Three Dominant Countries
![illustrative images](./SKetch2.jpeg)
This idea involves various countries using Star Chart in a small multiple way, showing the accumulated testing frequency of three dominant countries.
