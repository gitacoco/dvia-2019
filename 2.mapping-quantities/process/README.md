For this chart, I use a Stream Graph to simultaneously show the testing frequency of all countries (the retinal variable: shape) and each country (the retinal variable: color) during the progression of time lapse, reflecting the change of the overall trend while allowing people to identify the proportion of a specific country.

For this chart, I use lines to connect the testing active years of each country (the retinal variable: color, shape), whose continuity allows audiences to identify whether there is nuclear testing of a certain year. This is a method to address the 'lull' that resulted from the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in ’96 and the more recent resurgence in testing.

The Line Clock uses compound logic. The black indicator is a hour hand that is just like a normal clock, but the dial is applied a 24-hour system. And the incomplete arc represents a minute hand that is growing clockwise and will enter another round after resetting the count every 60 minutes. And the complete thicker loop radiates from the center of the circle to the periphery, which represents the second hand like a live breathing light. The dotted circle is a border of the second hand.
