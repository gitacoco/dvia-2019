In this Bar Clock, the three bars that are from thickest to thinnest respectively stand for the hour hand, minute hand and second hand. They move from left to right at their own speed.

The Pie Clock uses three pie charts to visulize elapsed time. These three pie charts are stacked from top to bottom in order from small to large, which respectively represents hour, minute and second.

The Line Clock uses compound logic. The black indicator is a hour hand that is just like a normal clock, but the dial is applied a 24-hour system. And the incomplete arc represents a minute hand that is growing clockwise and will enter another round after resetting the count every 60 minutes. And the complete thicker loop radiates from the center of the circle to the periphery, which represents the second hand like a live breathing light. The dotted circle is a border of the second hand.
