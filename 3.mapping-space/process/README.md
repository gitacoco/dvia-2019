## Process of Stones Unturned

### 1/ Exploratory Visualizations

> Start off by making pencil sketches for your non-spatial ‘diagrammatic’ representation of the data in the feeds. (Week 10 Assignment, 6 Nov 2019)

> On the mapping side of things, figure out what kinds of markers you’ll be adding. (Week 10 Assignment, 6 Nov 2019)

//Describe both the logic of your diagram designs and how they'll relate to the map representation on screen (i.e., is one a sidebar or inset to the other, are the graphics summarizing all earthquakes or do they detail specific ones selected from the map, etc.).

### 2/ Prototype

> Explore the selected direction and prototype the different component views that will make up your final visualization with a clear idea of how they will interact with one another. (Week 11 Assignment, 13 Nov 2019)

#### the First View: Visualize Frequency
